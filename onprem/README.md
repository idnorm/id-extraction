# On premise

Here we provide instructions how to deploy our service on your infrastructure. 

We provide two deployment options
 - docker compose 
    - We recommend using docker compose deployment to get started quickly and understand our API and service better. For testing and internal purposes. Docker compose does not offer you the flexibility of scaling the services nicely for high production loads. To get started follow instructions [here](docker-compose/README.md).
 - Helm chart
    - For production and highly available environments we ship and maintain helm chart repository for depolying our solution. To get started follow instructions here.
