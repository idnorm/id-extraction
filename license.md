# Idnorm license

To authorise and track our service usages by our clients we use licenses.

All of your licenses can be configured and viewed [here](https://www.idnorm.com/licenses).

When clients integrate our solution with theircodebase they must provide a **license key**. For each **license**, visible on the UI linked above,
you will be able to acquire the **license key**, which will be a simple `base64` encoded string value that must be provided for
authorization when calling Idnom APIs.

Once acquired do not share the **license key** with anyone outside your company as it is used for billing and usage tracking.
